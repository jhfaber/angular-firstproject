## How thouthgt in angular?

We need change our mentality for development in angular.

- We need think about components, it can be for just use one HTML, re-use follow the principle DRY (dont repeat yourself)
- Ts typescript is the logic for our angular application. 
- Import we need libraries, components for import...
- @Component: additional informacion as, selector (nickname for our component), templeteUrl(View html)
- export class etc, for attributes and make the logic of our application. 
- **Template** div our html in others pages.
- ng serve for run our project. localhost:4200

## Bootstrap install

For doing bootstrap is better dowload the project 

- npm install bootstrap --save
- In our **package.json** it install bring the boostrap and version (without save it dont keep save in package.json)
- In Angular-cli.json styles, we need write the path of bootstrap.min.css
